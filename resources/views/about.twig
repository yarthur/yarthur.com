<h1>Allow me to introduce myself.</h1>
	<p>I was born and raised in Nebraska; before obsessing over semantic markup and progressive enhancement, I was detasseling corn in the summers, and listening to Husker football on the radio in the fall. I met my wife, a Minneapolis native, at Creighton University, and was able to extol upon her the virtues of The Good Life. For a short while, I moved to the Twin Cities with her, before we returned to Omaha, where we had our daughter. Now my wife is attending UNL for her Doctoral degree, and we've added a son to the family roster.</p>
	<p>I first started playing with HTML in high school. As mentioned before, I had a trusty Geocities account, a copy of <span class="bookTitle">HTML For Dummies</span>, and an Internet connection. That first site was something of an abomination, with an embarrassing number of frames, blinking text, lightsaber HRs, and graphic backgrounds. At the same time, I was hooked by the freedom to create and publish whatever I felt like. The ability that the Internet has to quickly and easily allow someone to publish whatever they desire to a nearly infinite audience is still awe-inspiring to me, and I love seeing what people do with that. It was that power that led me to this profession, and I haven’t regretted it in the least.</p>
	<p>Beyond HTML, there are plenty of things that keep me occupied. My family is a big part of my life, and my children are especially adept at keeping me busy (and youthful — it’s disturbing how well I relate to a toddler's psyche). I love to spend time in the kitchen, cooking and baking, and then reaping the rewards. This has also led me to beer brewing, a newer hobby that I look forward to mastering. Finally, I’ve always enjoyed music — I have my headphones on more often than not, and though I haven’t made time to play my bass in way too long, I hope I will change that someday soon.</p>
